# Chess

I like to play chess, but I don't want to leave my terminal.

SOO like an engineer, this is my attempt to build a tui (terminal user interface) to play chess.

roadmap of things to learn in this repo:
- [ ] lichess.org endpoints, I think there is a way to communicate with a chess bot  
- [ ] different terminal UI packages or create my own...(probably not)

roadmap of features I want:
- [ ] input moves via terminal 
- [ ] send move to the engine/player
- [ ] receive new board position and prompt user again for move
- [ ] allow user to save the game (FEN or PGN or idk how else chess games are saved)
- [ ] room for more...
