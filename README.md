# go-chess

**go-chess** is a terminal-based chess application written in Go. It aims to provide a lightweight interface for playing chess directly from the command line. 


## Planned Features

- Move input via terminal. Lichess.org/api/board is the way to do this, but will also need goroutine to listen for moves after
- Communication with a chess engine or online opponent. Online opponent would be very exciting
- Optional features:
  - Offline play with basic engine logic.
  - User game history.

## Status

Work in progress. Primarily a personal learning project focused on Go, API integration, and TUI development.
